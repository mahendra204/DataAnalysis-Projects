## Movie IMDB Data analysis

Gathered the data from one of the online data source then with the help of pandas and depedning upon the type of data i have used sqlite and pandas to 
explore the data and done the data analysis as you can see in above python notebook.

In the data we have different movies directed in different years and with their rating and many more things as given in the data set. I have clearly analysed 
the entire data depending upon the in which year how many movies done by the director, highest movie maker and highest movie rating and many more things that 
i have analysed.

Thanks for visiting keep learning.
